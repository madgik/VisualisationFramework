# Visualisation Framework
The Data Visualization Framework has been designed and implemented with the vision to support the visualization of diverse data types, in different formats and with various visualizations. Aiming to be extensible in an easy way, its architecture follows a modular design, separating the data storage, the business logic and the front end / User Interface components.
The implemented architecture of the framework is available below:
